/**
 * Extensions to NSError providing a convenient way to create errors. Mutability methods have been implemented so that
 * information can be added to existing errors. The usual NSError interface only allows immutable errors creation, but:
 *   - creating errors this way is ugly (the error information must be provided as a dictionary with reserved keys)
 *   - when you want to add information, e.g. nest more errors as you perform validations in a row, you have to
 *     create a new error
 * The extensions below make error creation more descriptive by letting you add error information via properly named
 * methods. Moreover, they make it possible to add informaton to an existing error, without having to create a new
 * one. 
 *
 * Since conventional NSErrors are immutable, these extensions cheat by changing the object identity (dynamic
 * subclassing) when a mutator is first called, so that a mutable userInfo can be internally added. If you do 
 * not use any mutability method, these extension have no runtime or space cost in comparison to a standard NSError.
 *
 * The interface below enforces the link between accessor methods and underlying userInfo dictionary keys. This is not
 * required, as explained in the documentation:
 *   http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ErrorHandlingCocoa/ErrorHandling/ErrorHandling.html
